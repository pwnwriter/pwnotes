## About

Hello, I'm [pwnwriter][github], and this is a frontend for my compilation of
random notes gathered throughout the year. Here, you'll discover a diverse
array of notes spanning topics such as *Cybersecurity, shell scripting, rust,*
and much more, all available under the [MIT][License] license. These notes are
straightforward, nothing but raw insights into various subjects.
